List of problems solved; ideally solve them in golang, python, c++
	1. Write a function to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given array of non-negative, distinct integers
		Solution in golang
	2. Invert a binary tree
		Example 1:
			Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
			Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
		Example 2:
			Input: root = [2,1,3]
			Output: [2,3,1]
		Example 3:
			Input: root = []
			Output: []
		Constraints:
			The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
			-100 <= Node.val <= 100
